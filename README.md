# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
hi

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Step by step

### Estructure

```
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── imag/
├── node_modules/
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public/
├── src/
└── yarn.lock
```

### Containerization of the Project

A Dockerfile will be created in the project directory to containerize the application. The Dockerfile will contain the following instructions:

```
FROM node:20.5.1-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm cache clean --force
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

### Automation with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will be used to automate the containerization and deployment process of the application. Below is the YAML configuration file for GitHub Actions:

```
name: Docker Image CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
 
jobs:

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Docker Setup Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3.0.0
    - name: Docker Login
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD}}
    - name: Build and Push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5.0.0
      with:
          context: .  # Ruta al contexto de construcción (puede ser el directorio actual)
          file: ./Dockerfile  # Ruta al Dockerfile
          push: true  # Habilitar el empuje de la imagen
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/node-ci:latest  # Nombre y etiqueta de la imagen
      env:
          DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
```

_Note:_ 
It's also necessary to configure the secrets in GitHub.
